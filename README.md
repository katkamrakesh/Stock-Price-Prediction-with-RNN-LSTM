# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-RNN-LSTM

The art of forecasting stock prices has been a difficult task for many of the researchers and analysts. In fact, investors are highly interested in the research area of stock price prediction. For a good and successful investment, many investors are keen on knowing the future situation of the stock market. Good and effective prediction systems for stock market help traders, investors, and analyst by providing supportive information like the future direction of the stock market. With this notebook, I present a basic recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to predict stock market indices.
